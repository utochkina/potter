It was impossible to imagine a more impractical choice. Seven years after graduation, by the time she sat down to write a book, twenty-seven-year-old Rowling was a complete failure - she had no job, she separated from her husband and remained a single mother. There was barely enough money to simply pay the rent. Nevertheless, as she believes, it was the hopeless situation that pushed her to take up the business to which the soul was really lying - to write. "If I was to be successful in something else, perhaps I would never have mustered the courage to achieve the goal of what I truly love." Well, knowledge of classical philology helped to come up with many new words for the fantasy world.</p>

                    <p >Joan loved telling fairy tales since childhood. She wrote her first fairy tale at the age of 5-6 years. When she turned 9, her family moved to Tatshill. It was a difficult period: Joan's mother was often sick, relations with her father did not work out. The girl attended Weidin High School, where her mother worked. Favorite subjects of the writer were English and other foreign languages. She loved to tell her friends stories about heroic characters. Immediately after leaving school, she entered the University of Exeter, where she studied French. After completing her studies, she moved to London, where she briefly worked as a secretary-translator. In 1990 she moved to Manchester. Joan's mother, who had suffered from multiple sclerosis for a long time, also died in the same. Soon the future writer moved to Potrugalia, where she taught English. In between lessons, she wrote her novel about a boy who studied at a magic school and was distinguished by extraordinary abilities. In 1992, she marriedundefined a young journalist. A year later, the couple had a daughter, but they divorced. Joan and her little daughter moved to Edinburgh, closer to her sister. She received a grant from the Scottish Arts Council to complete her book. When it came time to publish her work, Joan faced many rejections. In the end, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was bought by Bloomsbury. After publication in the UK, Joan was talked about as a writer, and the Harry Potter book won the Book of the Year award. When the publishing house Arthur A. Levin / Uchebnaya Literatura bought the rights to the book for an impressive sum, the writer was able to quit teaching and devote herself entirely to writing. All subsequent books of the Harry Potter series became bestsellers, both in the UK and in the USA. The first Harry Potter movie was filmed in 2000 by Warner Brothers. There were eight adaptations in total, and all of them occupied leading positions. To date, stories about undefined Harry Potter and his fight against the Dark Lord have become some of the most popular children's books in the world. undefined</p>
